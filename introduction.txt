Welcome to TERMINAL BLACKJACK

Rules:

The goal is to finish the round with a 
score higher than the dealer without 
breaking over 21. The score is calculated 
based on the cards' values:
- Numeric cards equal their number
- Jacks, Queens and Kings equal 10
- Aces can equal  either 11 or 1, whichever
  doesn't make the score break over 21

The dealer starts with one card and each
player starts with 2. All cards are visible
at all times. The player starts by placing
a bet. They then have a choice of actions:

- If their hand starts with one ACE and
  another card that has a value of 10 (10s, 
  JACKS, QUEENS or KING), they have what is
  called a BLACKJACK! They cannot lose this
  round. No other action can be taken with
  taken with such a hand.

- If their hand starts with two ACES, the 
  player can choose to SPLIT their hand in 
  two by doubling their bet. This gives them
  two active hands on this round, therefore
  two chances at beating the dealer. Only one
  hand needs to WIN for the player to WIN.
  Split hands are elligible for a BLACKJACK.
  This action is not available if the bet has
  been doubled down and makes doubling down
  unavailable.

- They can HIT, which means draw another card,
  at the risk of their score going over 21,
  which is called a BUST. This action can be
  repeated as long as the hand isn't BUSTED.
  CAREFUL: The player is offered to hit even
  if they already reached 21. It is up to them
  to choose the proper option at that point.

- On the first action, they can DOUBLE DOWN, which 
  means to HIT while doubling the initial bet.
  This option is not available if the hand has
  been split and makes splitting unavailable.

- On the first action, they can SURRENDER, halving
  their bet, but effectively halting their turn and
  losing that round.

- They can STAND, which means they are satisfied
  with that hand's score and will await the
  round's resolution.

Once the player has completed their turn, it's time
for the dealer to resolve their hand. They will draw
cards in attempt to win. The resolutions can be:

- The dealer has a BLACKJACK: Any player without
  a BLACKJACK of their own loses their bet. A player
  with a BLACKJACK would recover their bet without
  winning extra coins (STANDOFF).

- The dealer BUSTS: All hands who didn't bust WIN!
  The player wins an amount of coins equivalent to
  their bet. Players with BUSTED hands still LOSE
  their bet. 

- The dealer's score is higher than a hand's score
  (without being BUSTED): The player's hand LOSES.

- The dealer's score is lower than a hand's score
  (without being BUSTED): The player WINS!

- It's a tie (STANDOFF): The player recovers their bet
  without winning extra coins.
